# Bring your own angular
This project was build by me to get a better grasp of which problems angular is trying to tackle for developers.

# Scope
The originalscope is to build an internal project that gives the following features to this project

1. Components
2. Routing
3. Injectable services

## 1. Components
The components should be reusable. The following things should be possible:

1. Create a component with a style and a html template.
2. Create a component within a component.


## 2. Routing
The app will have a home page and a secondary page. 
A component should be able to be linked as the entry component of the page.
